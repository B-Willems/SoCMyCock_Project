TIMING-2#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock System_i/ClockingWizard/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate pin System_i/ClockingWizard/inst/clk_in1. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
